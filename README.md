## Projects

1. Breast Cancer Prediction using KNN

Sure, here's an updated summary of the "Breast Cancer Prediction Using KNN" project that includes the confusion matrix:

The "Breast Cancer Prediction Using KNN" project is aimed at predicting the presence of breast cancer in patients based on their cell characteristics using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset contains ten attributes including cell thickness, uniformity of cell size and shape, and others, as well as a binary class variable indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer.

The project used KNN algorithm to train a model on the dataset, and evaluated its performance using a test set. The model achieved an accuracy of 99%, with a high precision and recall rate for both benign and malignant cases. The confusion matrix of the model on the test set is:

|   | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual Negative** | 141 | 1 |
| **Actual Positive** | 2 | 66 |

The high accuracy and the high precision and recall rates for both classes indicate that the model is effective in predicting breast cancer using cell characteristics. This project demonstrates the potential of KNN algorithm for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, and its application in the medical field.
